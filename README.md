👋 Hi there! I'm Anand P S, a passionate third-year Computer Science student diving into the world of open-source contributions on GitHub.

💻 With a solid grasp of programming fundamentals and a hunger for learning, I'm excited to embark on this journey of collaborating with developers from around the globe to build impactful projects.

🌐 Although I'm just starting my journey in software development, I'm eager to contribute to projects that align with my interests and skills. My primary focus is on web development, where I have experience with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as basic knowledge of frameworks like Angular.

🚀 I'm enthusiastic about learning new technologies and methodologies, and I'm committed to making meaningful contributions to open-source projects. Whether it's fixing bugs, improving documentation, or implementing new features, I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and get involved.

🔍 Currently seeking beginner-friendly projects where I can gain hands-on experience, learn from experienced developers, and make valuable contributions to the community.

📚 Outside of coding, you'll find me exploring various hobbies, from hiking in nature to experimenting with cooking new recipes.

📩 Let's connect and collaborate! Whether you're a seasoned developer looking for contributors or a fellow newcomer eager to learn together, I'm excited to be part of the open-source community and contribute to projects that make a difference.
